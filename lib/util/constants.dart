I am here to share my knowledge with you, let's grow together! In this post I will be answering some questions that you may have, that I asked before embarking on this journey. What is UI/UX? While they usually both come up in the same context, UI is not UX. UI fully called User interface refers to what consumers/people who use a product see when they interact with the product. For example, what you see when you go on a website; the arrangement of the sections, the website layout, down to the colours used are functions of the UI. UX on the other hand is known as user experience. From the word ‘experience’, you have a vague idea of its meaning. Basically, how a customer/prospective feel when they use or interact with a product. They work in tandem in the process of product design.  User interface is involved in everyday life, because we interact with software everyday. Your smartphone was designed with UI, the apps on your phone? UI, the atm, UI and a lot more. UX now, is the workability and usability of a product's UI. Have you ever gone on Playstore or AppStore to download an app and read the reviews? Some people complain about icons that are too small or too large, that's an example of a bad UX. It's a result of a bad UI.  To avoid such case of a bad UI there are principles of design that serve as a guide. They vary in number depending on who you ask. I will discuss six now | Balance Visual hierarchy  Emphasis Contrast  Repetition Negative Space Balance  Balance is created when you distribute design across the page. It would be unwise to fill just one side of the page with good design and leave the other half empty. The ability to distribute, combine and align design give a good balance.";
